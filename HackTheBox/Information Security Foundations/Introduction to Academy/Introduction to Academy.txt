Introduction

Welcome to HTB Academy!

HTB Academy's goal is to provide a highly interactive and streamlined learning process to allow users to have fun while learning. Content within Academy is based around the concept of "guided learning". Students are presented with material in digestible chunks with examples of commands and their output throughout, not just theory. Students are provided target hosts where they can reproduce the materials presented in each section for themselves, hands-on exercises that serve as "checkpoints", and skills assessments to test their understanding of the material.

The key component of the learning process in the Academy is the Module. You are actually following one right now. Academy modules are designed to serve as mini standalone courses with all of the knowledge needed to complete the hands-on exercises and skills assessments taught within the module. While modules are standalone, many are related or build on each other.

The structure of the Academy is as follows:

A Module is split into Sections and a Path contains many modules. We will dive deeper into these meanings in the following sections.
Paths

Paths are collections of modules (i,e, a path named Basic Toolset may include modules on nmap, sqlmap, Hashcat, and other tools).
Modules

Modules always focus on specific topics or tools to help students enhance their skillset in a particular area. Many modules are scenario-based and make an effort to follow steps that would be taken in a real-world assessment to make the material extremely useful and relevant for students who are new to infosec or students looking to enhance their knowledge in a certain topic area.
Sections

Modules are broken down into sections. These sections are the "meat" of the modules and contain the subject matter being taught, relevant command output, and hands-on exercises.

Sections

Interactive Section

Interactive Sections, as stated previously, require one or more answers from you in order to complete them.

You can always skip an interactive section by clicking Next, although the section will remain incomplete until you submit all the correct answers.

To complete this Interactive Section, answer the question below.

Questions:

Answer the question(s) below to complete this Section and earn cubes!

Interactive Section with Terminal

This Interactive Section also includes a Linux instance.

You can use the instance directly from below or click Full Screen to open a full-screen instance in a new browser window.

On the top left part of the instance window, you will see a few icons. The one you will find yourself using the most is the bash terminal.

Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

    Click the Start Instance button
    Try to locate the bash terminal icon and click it!
        Hint: Look for the icons in the top-left section of the instance.
    Type uname -a and press Enter in the terminal window.
        Tip: This will return some useful information about the specific flavor of the OS and its kernel.

Interactive Section with Target

Sometimes we need to interact with live targets to make the learning process more effective and more realistic.

Like My Workstation, targets are also spawned on-demand.

If a section requires interaction with a Target, you can spawn it from the bottom of the page, in the top part of Questions.

Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

    Spawn your target!
    Spawn My Workstation if you haven't done so.
    From your workstation, open Firefox and browse to the target URL.

Interactive sections within the modules will have either an accompanying Docker target, a single VM, or multiple VMs, depending on the material. After spawning the target, there are a few ways you can interact with it.
Docker Target

For modules that use a Docker target, the instance will take the form of http://<ip>:<port> after spawning, i.e. http://157.245.40.149:30655. Once this image spawns, you can choose to interact with it from the provided Pwnbox, your own VM, etc. Docker images will typically spawn more quickly than VMs. Click on Click here to spawn the target system! to spawn the target Docker image.

VM Target

Modules that have either a Windows target, Active Directory (AD) environment, require multiple hosts, or otherwise cannot be completed using a Docker image will have an accompanying VM or set of VMs. You can click to spawn this target the same way. If the target VM requires authentication, you will be provided with credentials to authenticate via SSH. WinRM, RDP, etc. If you are not provided with credentials, it is safe to assume that you must attack the target from an unauthenticated standpoint unless otherwise instructed. If you choose to interact with the target via the Pwnbox, you will be automatically connected to the Academy lab VPN once the Pwnbox and target VM are spawned. Click on Click here to spawn the target system! to spawn the target VM.

Alternatively, you can choose to download a VPN key to interact with target VMs from your own attack box. Any targets with an accompanying VPN key will have a download button next to the Cheat Sheet on the right-hand side of the first exercise box.

You can see how much time your target has left directly under the IP address information. If your target expires, becomes unusable or unstable for any reason, feel free to click the orange arrows to spawn a fresh target. Each user can spawn their own dedicated targets. Any data (i.e., tools) saved to the target will be lost when the target either expires or a new target is spawned.

Let's try this out by spawning the target below!

Modules

Modules are aimed at teaching you a specific topic. They contain several Sections, and many are Interactive.

Modules can be standalone, like the one you are currently working on, or they can be part of a Path, which we will outline in the next section.

You can browse available modules on the Modules page and start training by clicking the Start button on each relevant module card.

All Modules will require a certain amount of Cubes to be unlocked. As we discussed previously, you can get more by completing Interactive Sections or by choosing a subscription.
Module Tiers

Modules are split into 5 different Tiers. These tiers are an easy way to group modules into distinct categories based on their cost. Notice that a high Tier doesn't necessarily equate to a high difficulty.

Tier 0 modules are free. There is a catch though. :) Tier 0 modules actually cost 10 cubes. However, they award the same amount by completing all questions. This is to incentivize our users to complete each module.

Tier I modules cost 50 cubes and reward back to the users 10 cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier II modules cost 100 cubes and reward back to the users 20 cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier III modules cost 500 cubes and reward back to the users 100 cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier IV modules cost 1000 cubes and reward back to the users 200 cubes if they complete all questions.
To-Do List

You can add the modules you plan to take to your To-Do list visible in your Dashboard. To add or remove a module from your To-Do list, click the heart icon located at the top right part of each module card in the Modules page.
Stopping/Resuming

You can stop working with a Module any time by simply navigating away or closing your browser. Your progress is saved every time you mark a section as complete using the Mark Complete and Next button.
Skills Assessment

Many but not all modules will have a final skills assessment (in addition to the in-module exercises) that must be taken to reach full completion and earn all cubes that the module awards. Skills assessments are performed against a separate target host. These assessments aim to test the students' knowledge of the material covered within the module sections and are designed to reinforce concepts presented in the module text. Depending on the module's size and the breadth and depth of the content, a skills assessment may require multiple steps and contain multiple questions. Other modules may have a skills assessment that only requires the student to perform a task (i.e., exploit a web application vulnerability) and submit a single flag.
Completion

A Module is marked complete once all the sections are marked as completed. This includes the Interactive sections of the module, meaning you need to submit the correct answers.

===

Paths

Paths are sets of Modules that, combined, make up a broader topic.

Paths can be large "zero-to-hero" ones or smaller, more specialized ones targeting a specific set of topics. You can view what each path is about by expanding the Modules it contains.

Some Paths share modules, especially in the first steps of a path. This allows you to fast-forward a Path given that you already possess the required entry-level knowledge.

For example, imagine a scenario where you are interested in following two imaginary Paths:

    Active Directory Attacks and Defense
    Modern Web Attacks

Both paths would make sense to have some entry-level Modules to teach you the basics of Active Directory and web applications. Once you complete the first Path, given that the paths share the same entry-level Modules, you automatically save time on your second Path since you will start directly after the shared entry-level topics.
