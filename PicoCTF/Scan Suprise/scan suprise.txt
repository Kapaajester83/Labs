Description
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead? You can download the challenge files here:

    challenge.zip

The same files are accessible via SSH here: ssh -p 59056 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net Using the password 6dd28e9b. Accept the fingerprint with yes, and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!

Hints

QR codes are a way of encoding data. While they're most known for storing URLs, they can store other things too.

Mobile phones have included native QR code scanners in their cameras since version 8 (Oreo) and iOS 11

If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text
